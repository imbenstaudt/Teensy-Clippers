Phob assembly requires that a Teensy 4.0 sits perched on a series of headers. However, the recommended headers are usually far too long and they must be cut flush in order for the teensy to fit in the controller.

This project is designed to give the end user a consistent and quick experience flush cutting headers for a good fitment in the shell with the bracket. 

Teensy board Z: 1.57mm
Teensy Clippers: 1.40mm

Just set your headers and place the Teensy Clippers on top, then flush cut. Even if you have a small amount of header material remaining, the thinner profile of the Teensy Clippers means that you'll get a consistent and flat Teensy to solder in, without worrying about headers going too high, or worse, cutting one too low by hand and ruining the header. 

STL dimensions are in mm. Slice with your preferred software and print accordingly.
